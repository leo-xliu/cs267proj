# PyPPL
cs267a final project implementing a first-order, discrete PPL on python with monte carlo inference, importance sampling, and mcmc

## Testing 

### Unit Testing 
We use Pythonâ€™s built-in `unittest` framework. See the [unittest docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for details.

To run all unit tests from the project root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Additional Goal
Build a command-line REPL for our PPL so user can write their probablistic program and inference it directly from the terminal
